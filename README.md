> An implementation of the minimax algorithm, optimized with alpha-beta pruning, to create a perfect Tic-Tac-Toe AI opponent. This project demonstrates optimal decision-making in a zero-sum game.

## 🧠 Algorithm Explained

This project isn't just a game; it's a demonstration of a classic artificial intelligence algorithm. The AI's logic is powered by **minimax**, a recursive algorithm used for choosing the optimal move in two-player games.

To make the decision-making process highly efficient, minimax is enhanced with **alpha-beta pruning**. This optimization safely prunes large parts of the game tree that don't need to be evaluated, significantly speeding up the AI's move calculation without affecting the outcome. The result is an AI that always plays the best possible move.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Unbeatable AI Opponent:** The AI will never lose. The best possible outcome for a human player is a draw.
* **Optimal Move Calculation:** Utilizes the minimax algorithm to explore all possible game outcomes.
* **High-Performance Pruning:** Implements alpha-beta pruning to drastically reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree, ensuring fast and efficient move generation.
* **Interactive Interface:** A clean, simple web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to play against and test the AI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core Algorithm:** JavaScript (for Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning logic)
* **Interface:** HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, ReactJS & Tailwind CSS
